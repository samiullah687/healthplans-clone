            us to contact you by telephone, signing up to receive news and
            information by providing your email address, or any other means we
            might make available, you accept and agree to these Terms of Use. If

          <p>
            HealthPlans.com provides you the opportunity to obtain quotes from
            insurance carriers and other service providers. Once you provide us
            with certain information regarding your insurance needs, we attempt
            to match you with appropriate offerings and provide links to further
            information or to apply for coverage. While we publish content on
            the Site about insurance, we do not provide tax or financial advice
            of any kind. We do not guarantee that any policy for which you apply
            will be approved, or that any insurance carrier or other service
            provider to which we link will review your application or contact
            you. We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of the
            insurance carriers and other companies whose products may be
            displayed on the Site. The policy provided by any insurance provider
            will be subject to the terms and conditions under which it is
            issued, and we have no control over such terms and conditions. While
            we make every attempt to publish current information regarding a
            variety of insurance offerings, such information is presented
            without guarantee or warranty. After selecting a link to an
            insurance carrier or other service provider, you will be taken to
            such party's site where you can review the \ applicable terms and
            conditions.
