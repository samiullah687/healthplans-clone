            We are QuoteLab, LLC, and we do business as MediaAlpha. We provide
            marketplaces connecting consumers like you with businesses that
            provide or are able to connect you with other businesses that
            provide insurance, finance, travel, and other products and services
            that may be of interest to you, or that you may wish to purchase or
            request a quote or rates for. We refer to these businesses as
            advertisers or our network of advertisers. You may access our
            marketplaces through the websites we own and operate, our web forms
            that are embedded in our websites and those embedded in certain
            third-party websites that we partner with, by calling us, or by
            asking us to call, email, or text you.

          <p>
            We do not provide rates, quotes, travel, insurance, or finance
            products or services. The rates and quotes we show you are from
            advertisers participating in our marketplaces.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not act as an agent for any advertiser participating in our
            marketplaces nor do we sell the products or services of such
            advertisers.

            our marketplaces in the way that's right for you.

          <p>
            Websites and apps maintained by other businesses are not covered by
            this Policy. The privacy policy of such businesses or advertisers
            applies to any information you provide to them or is collected
            automatically by them (or their agents, service providers, or
            partners) from you. You can review their privacy policy on their
            website or app to learn how they receive and process your
            information. In some cases, they may use a separate service provider
            to receive and process your information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The websites and apps maintained by other businesses that are not
            covered by this Policy include the websites and apps owned and
            operated by advertisers participating in our network of advertisers
            (that you connect with through our marketplaces). For example, when
            you use our marketplaces to connect with our network of advertisers,
            the advertisers we connect you with will handle the information you
            instructed us to share with them (to learn more about the
            advertiser’s products and services that interest you, or to request
            a quote or rates, or to purchase their products and services) and
            any other information you share with them according to their own

            The information we collect and process about you also depends on the
            purpose of your use. For example, we collect different information
            when you use our marketplaces to connect you with advertisers that
            offer insurance products and services than when you use our
            marketplaces to connect with advertisers that offer travel products
            and services.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to remember that you may use our marketplaces by
            using our websites, by using our web forms embedded in our websites,
            by using our web forms that are embedded in the third-party websites
            that we partner with, by calling us using the telephone numbers we
            provide on our websites, by asking an advertiser to transfer the
            call you made to them to us, or by asking us to call, email, or text
            you, and by signing up for one of our marketing lists.

              that you may provide us and that we will collect from you will be
              presented to you at the time you make your request. For example,
              if you are using our marketplaces to connect with advertisers for
              travel products and services we may ask you to provide us your
              home and destination airports, number of stops, number of
              travelers, and travel dates so that we can identify and connect
              you with relevant advertisers, and display the top matches from
              our network of advertisers to you by showing you the flight and
              hotel options available from them.

          <p>
            As described in this Policy, our marketplaces are designed to
            connect you with advertisers so you can learn more about their
            products and services, so you can request quotes and rates directly
            from them, and so you can purchase from them those products and
            services of your choosing. With this in mind, we share the
            information we have collected about you in the following ways:
          </p>

          <ul>

              When you click on an advertisement displayed on our websites
              (e.g., online ads, text, video, or other interactive content,
              products and services information, rates, quotes, links, etc.
              (example)), you will navigate to that advertiser's (which may
              include businesses, agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other
              types of advertisers in our network) website or app and your click
              will authorize us to share information we have collected about you
              with the advertiser as part of your navigation to their website.
              For example, information that helps the advertiser understand you
              are navigating from our website and information about the
              advertisement you clicked on to navigate to their website.

              When you submit a request through our marketplaces by using our
              web forms embedded in our websites or our web forms embedded in
              the websites of the third-parties we partner with, by calling us,
              or by asking us to call, email, or text you, you instruct us to
              share and we will share the information you submit in your request
              with advertisers participating in our marketplaces (which may
              include businesses, agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other
              types of advertisers in our network) so they know your request is
              coming from us and so they can process and respond to your
              request. Please keep in mind the following important details when
              using our web forms, when calling us, or when we call, email, or
              text you:
              <ul>

                  By submitting your request, you agree that we and our
                  advertisers may contact you by phone (including through
                  automated calling, live operators, or using recorded
                  messages), text messages, email, or postal mail (the methods
                  used to contact you will be based on the information you
                  provide to us and the consent we receive from you), to
                  process, respond to, and fulfill your request or to market
                  products and services that might be of interest to you, even
                  if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List
                  (administered by the Federal Trade Commission) or any similar
                  mechanism to opt-out of receiving phone calls or email. If
                  later you wish not to be contacted by any advertiser, then you
                  will need to contact such advertiser directly to make a
                  request (see the advertiser's privacy policy to learn how to

            marketplaces work?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our marketplaces contain various forms of advertisements from our
            network of advertisers which may be presented to you in various
            forms including as online ads, text, video, or other interactive
            content, products and services information, rates, quotes, links,
            etc. (<a

              href="javascript:void(0);"
              >Advertiser Results</a
            >). For example, when you submit information through our websites
            and web forms, in response to your request to be connected with our
            network of advertisers, you will be presented with advertisements
            displayed as content and links to websites owned and operated by
            advertisers participating in our marketplaces. By clicking on these
            links you will navigate to their website or app where you may learn
            more about their products and services or request a quote or rates
            directly from them, or purchase products and services from them, or
            communicate directly with them. As noted above, when you click on an
            advertisement displayed to you, you will be providing information to
            the advertiser as well as to us and any other business partners or
            other third parties we work with. We are not responsible for how an
            advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your
            information. As always, we encourage you to read the privacy
            policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit
            or use. To learn more, see

            How long do we keep the information we collect?
          </h2>

          <p>
            How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the
            amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the purpose for
            which it was provided and the purposes for which the information is
            used, whether we are able to obtain the business objective by other
            means, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
            disclosure of the information, our legal, regulatory, tax,
            accounting and other applicable obligations, and other similar
            factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generally, we retain the information we collect about you only for
            as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which
            it was collected. For example, we keep the information we collect:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Through our marketplaces (like your name, phone number, address,
              email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes
              outlined in this Policy (including for as long as need to provide
              you with our services), unless a longer retention period is
              required or permitted by law.
            </li>
            <li>
              For as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our
              rights and agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it is aggregated, anonymized, and/or de-identified (i.e., no
              longer or otherwise not capable of identifying you) then
              indefinitely.
            </li>
            <li>
              In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of
              time or as permitted by applicable law.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If necessary, however, we may retain the information we collect
            about you for longer periods of time after the set retention periods
            and deadlines expire such as where we are required to do so in
            accordance with legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements set by a
            legislature, regulator, or other government authority. We may also
            retain information longer as necessary to resolve disputes and
            defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the
            choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once retention of the information we collect about you is no longer
            necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete,
            aggregate, anonymize, or de-identify the information or, if this is
            not possible (for example, because the information is stored in
            backup archives), then we will securely store the information we
            have collected about you and isolate it from further processing
            until deletion or deidentification is possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you ever decide to stop using our marketplaces, you may ask us to
            delete your information (see

          <p>
            Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out deletion
            automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will
            occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal
            requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a
            deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not
            delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us
            to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or
            other

            disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical,
            electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed
            federal standards to guard your information, and we aggregate,
            de-identify, anonymize, or expunge data when it is no longer
            necessary to provide services to our users or substantiate records
            for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security
            procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect,
            impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant
            or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain
            secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be
            accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized
            manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business
            online.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to
            notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
            protective steps. We may also post a notice on our services if a
            security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a
            legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If
            you have any questions about the security of your information,
            please

            As discussed <a href="#info-we-collect-websites-webform">above</a>,
            we use cookies and similar technologies (such as pixels, tags,
            beacons, scripts, and other technologies and unique identifiers),
            including data that we store on your web browser or device,
            identifiers associated with your device and other software to
            provide and make our services to you and to our network of
            advertisers work. This means advertisers, our business partners
            (including any other third parties working on our behalf or who
            collect information on our services on our behalf), may
            automatically receive certain information associated with you and/or
            your device(s) as part of your use of our websites and web forms
            through such browser or device-based collection technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many devices and browsers give you the option to manage and/or
            disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out
            of the use of these technologies, you may change your browser
            options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting
            cookies. To assist you, we compiled directions for some commonly
            used browsers and devices in the table below. Keep in mind that not
            all devices and browsers are the same so the methods described below
            may not work for your browser, browser version, or device and may
            change at any time. We encourage you to refer to the relevant
            instructions for your particular device or browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before you dive in, please note, if you opt out of the collection
            and use of information via cookies and other technologies, you may
            still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks
            from which you have not opted out. In addition, your opt-out will
            not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that
            is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may
            be less relevant to you. You will need to make such choices on each
            browser and device you may use to visit our websites and web forms.

              <strong>Disabling Cookies in Browsers</strong> When you elect to
              opt-out on a website, including our websites, an opt-out cookie is
              placed on your device. Then when you visit the same website, the
              opt-out cookie tells the website you opted out. This means that
              blocking all cookies may then prevent the websites from operating
              as expected and may also prevent your consent choices from being
              stored. This may mean that if you opt-out and then block cookies,
              we may not know about, or be able to honor, your opt-out. You
              should also be aware that blocking cookies on your computer will
              not affect your consent choices on a different device, such as a
              mobile device. You may want to keep this in mind when determining
              your browser cookie settings. For more information on how to
              disable cookies on the most common browsers see below.
